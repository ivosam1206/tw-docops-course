# Ivo Sam's DocOps Repository

I am learning new ways of documentating. DocOps is one of these and I am thrilled to start doing it. In the past I have been interested in stop delivering doments in GDocs, and move to something better for the client.

I am so in with this initiative.

These are the reasons why I want to do it:
- Because I like it
- Because I want to

To achieve to transition, we need to do the folllowing:

1. Want to do it
2. Do it

The following table represent my need to move to DocOps

|  Reason | Importance level | 
|---|---|
| Better practice  | Kind of important  | 
| Personal relevance  | Very important  |


```
function test() {
  console.log("Move to DocOps!");
}
```
